# Quizzical
This is general trivia game to be played with yourself or friends.

## Description

This project was made using Visual Code for the IDE along with React and Vite for compiling the code. This application reaches out to the Open Trivia Database API for the questions displayed in the application.
You can select the trivia category from list of categories available from the Trivia Database API.  You can also choose the level of difficulty for the questions.  Only five questions are displayed at a time.  The application will tell you how you did on the quiz when you select the "Check answers" button.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The dependencies are React and the Vite compiler.  I also used Visual Studio Code to make the project from scratch.  Because of the API calls and React used in the project, it must be ran in a server environment.  Visual Studio Code makes this really easy if you enable the "Live Server" extension.  If you have quesitons about that, you can find sources on how to enable the extension on YouTube.

### Installing for Windows

You can make a pull request from this repository and save it onto your local computer.  From there, open up the folder location with Visual Studio Code and run it with the live server extension.  However, you will have to make sure you have NPM installed onto your local machine first and run the following commands in your terminal within Visual Studio Code "npm install" followed by "npm run dev"  or combine the terminal commands like "npm install && npm run dev".  If you don't know whether or not NPM is installed on your computer, type "npm -v" into your command terminal first.  It should return a number if it is installed.  You also have to ensure you are in the right folder directory of this project if you receive an error in the terminal within Visual Studio Code.

### React + Vite

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
